Dependency-Shot module

The Dependency-Shot module helps you to inject Dependency-Shot managed components into your Play! application. The injection points are defined by the  @javax.inject.Inject annotation. 

Enable the Dependency-Shot  module for the application

You can enable the Dependency-Shot module by adding the following line to your application's **/conf/application.conf** file:

module.dependencyshot=${play.path}/modules/dependencyshot

Defining a Dependency-Shot binder :

just add in your code a class extending cx.ath.mancel01.dependencyshot.graph.Binder and write your bindings in the configureBindings method.
