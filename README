The main goal of dependency-shot is to implement the JSR-330, known as Dependency Injection for Java, in a simple and easy to use framework. Dependency-shot is also an educational framework to understand the principles of dependency injection, inversion of control and aspect oriented programming with a framework.

You can find the final release of the JSR-330 on the JSR-330 specification website or on the atinject project on google code. You can also find the code of the Reference Implementation on the Guice trunk.
